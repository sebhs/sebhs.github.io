        <h1>what I believe in</h1>
        <h3><u>unblocking the team</u> over individual contribution</h3>
        <p>There is a huge <a href="https://blackswanfarming.com/cost-of-delay/" target="_blank">cost of delay.</a> If we unblock each other we’ll move faster as a team. We can do individual work when we are not blocking anyone.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3><u>pragmatism</u> over maintaining status quo</h3>
        <p>Too often, we do things a certain way just because "it's always been done this way." If something is inefficient, figure out why. If there's no good reason, get rid of it.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3><u>simple language</u> over sounding smart </h3>
        <p>Communication is about conveying an idea from one brain to another. Simple language is the most effective way of doing that. Being simple and concise is much harder than sounding intelligent. (I like <a href="https://www.animalz.co/blog/bottom-line-up-front/" target="_blank">BLUF</a>).</p>
        <br/>
        <h3><u>asking</u> over assuming </h3>
        <p>When in doubt, ask. It is better to ask too much than to ask too little. If you ask a lot, you learned a lot. If you learn a lot, you grow a lot. </p>
        <br/>
        <h3><u>show</u> over tell </h3>
        <p>If you want to convince someone of something, show them. This will work better than just telling them. </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h3>Finally, don’t forget - there will always be someone better than you, but there will never be a better <i>you</i>.</h3>
