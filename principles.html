      <strong>what I believe in:</strong>
    </p>
    <br />

    <strong><u>unblocking the team</u> over individual contribution</strong>
    <p>
      there is a huge
      <a href="https://blackswanfarming.com/cost-of-delay/" target="_blank"
        >cost of delay.</a
      >
      we need to unblock each other as a team to move fast. individual work can
      be done when you aren't blocking.
    </p>
    <br />
    <strong><u>pragmatism</u> over status quo</strong>
    <p>
      often we do things a certain way because "it's always been done this way."
      if something is inefficient, figure out why. no good reason? get rid of
      it.
    </p>
    <br />
    <strong><u>simple language</u> over sounding smart </strong>
    <p>
      communication is about conveying an idea from one brain to another. simple
      language is the most effective way of doing that. being simple is harder
      than sounding smart. I like

      >.
    </p>
    <br />
    <strong><u>asking</u> over assuming </strong>
    <p>
      i will ask a lot of questions, even if they sound stupid. i'd rather ask
      than assume something and be wrong.
    </p>
    <br />
    <strong><u>convenience</u> over quality </strong>
    <p>
      everyone agrees that the quality of a product matters - a lot. however, if
      products aren't convenient to use, no one will use them.
    </p>

    <br />
    <strong>
      default to the left. be intentional when picking the right.
