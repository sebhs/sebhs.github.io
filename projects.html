      <strong>enerwise stromprofilanalyse - 2024</strong>
      <p>
        create a tool to analyze the energy load profile (lastgang) for german
        businesses. this will show where their energy consumption peaked
        throughout the year and allow them to compare prices using dynamic spot
        tariffs versus fixed-cost tariffs. this was built as part of a
        validation process to assess the feasibility of building a business
        centered around energy management for smbs in germany. we had 20 energy
        brokers using the tool who really liked it. however, we only managed to
        sell one analysis. we also realized we weren't that excited about the
        market and decided to move on. try it out using the link below.

      <strong>abstract-dcgan - 2020</strong>
      <p>
        abstract-dcgan is a deep learning model that uses a deep convolutional
        generative adversarial network (dcgan) architecture to generate abstract
        artwork. the model was trained on a large dataset of abstract artworks
        from the likes of jackson pollock, mark rothko, and franz kline. the
        model consists of two networks: a generator and a discriminator. the
        generator network takes a random noise vector as input and outputs an
        image, while the discriminator network tries to distinguish between real
        and generated images. the two networks are trained together in a process
        called adversarial training, where the generator tries to create fake
        data discriminator network tries to distinguish between real and
        generated images. the two networks are trained together in a process
        called adversarial training, where the generator tries to create fake
        data that looks as real as possible, while the discriminator tries to
        distinguish between real and fake data. over time, the generator learns
        to create more realistic images, while the discriminator improves at
        distinguishing between the real and fake (generated) images. eventually,
        the generator is capable of creating the abstract artwork seen here.

        - ps: in college nico and i were too stupid to figure out how to use git
        and get the model to run on my machine. so we mostly paired on the code
        and he committed everything under his github account.
