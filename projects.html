      <strong>abstract-DCGAN - 2020</strong>
      <p>
        I built abstract-DCGAN with my classmate nico garcia for a class project
        in stanford's CS230 deep learning course. abstract-DCGAN is a deep
        learning model that uses a deep convolutional generative adversarial
        network (DCGAN) architecture to generate abstract artwork. the model was
        trained on a large dataset of abstract artworks from the likes of
        jackson pollock, mark rothko, and franz kline. the model consists of two
        networks: a generator and a discriminator. the generator network takes a
        random noise vector as input and outputs an image, while the
        discriminator network tries to distinguish between real and generated
        images. the two networks are trained together in a process called
        adversarial training, where the generator tries to create fake data that
        looks as real as possible, while the discriminator tries to distinguish
        between real and fake data. over time, the generator learns to create
        more realistic images, while the discriminator improves at
        distinguishing between the real and fake (generated) images. eventually,
        the generator is capable of creating the abstract artwork seen here.

        - ps: in college nico and I were too stupid to figure out how to use git
        and get the model to run on my machine. so we mostly paired on the code
        and he committed everything under his github account.

      <strong>my.card - 2019</strong>
      <p>
        my.card is a contact sharing app that makes it easy for you to share
        your contact via a qr code. The initial app I built with two friends in
        2016, but we never launched it. I then re-built the app again in 2019,
        but didn't launch again. lesson: launch quick.
